Not only can it be repaired like its $(l:items/infused_iron_armor)infused counterpart$(), it also provides a $(thing)set bonus$(): When wearing every piece of the armor (or swapping the chestplate for an $(item)Elytra$()), the wearer's $(thing)movement speed$() will be increased. Additionally, their ability to $(thing)step up$() onto blocks will be heightened, removing their requirement to jump as often."
