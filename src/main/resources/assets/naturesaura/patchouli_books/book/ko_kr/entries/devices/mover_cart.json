For this, the $(item)Aura Attraction Cart$() was developed: Its sole purpose is to provide the ability for $(aura) to be moved around the world easily. For that, all that is required is an excess amount of $(aura) in the starting area and some $(item)rails$()."

To cause it to hook on to $(aura) in the area around it and to make it able to move it around, it needs to pass a powered $(item)Activator Rail$(). It will then pick up the $(aura) around it and pull it along with it until it reaches an unpowered $(item)Activator Rail$(), at which point it will let go of the $(aura).$(p)It should be noted that, during the process of moving $(aura) in this manner, some of the excess is $(thing)$(t:| || || |_)lost$()."
