The $(item)Firecracker Gaze$() seemingly shares this opinion especially: Consuming any fireworks that are $(thing)dropped$() on the ground around it, it will shoot them up into the air. Once they explode, their explosive and colorful energy is absorbed, and, based on the complexity of the firework,"

For the complexity, especially the $(thing)value$() of the items used in the firework's creation is of importance, but also, the amount of $(thing)firework stars$(), the amount of $(thing)colors$() and some other variables factor into the amount of $(aura) created from each shot."

This implies that it would be wise to set up some sort of $(thing)timer$() for its automation."
