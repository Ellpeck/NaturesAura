Over the years, magical botanists have tried to find a way to manipulate $(thing)time$() itself for personal gain. The $(item)Shifting Sundial$() has the ability to do exactly that. While quite expensive to set up, it has the ability to fast forward to $(thing)any time of day or night$() with ease."

The $(thing)rotation$() of the hand in the frame will then determine the time that will be skipped to, with the hand pointing to the top corresponding to midnight. To activate a time skip, a regular $(item)Clock$() has to be dropped very close to the sundial.$(br)This, of course, comes at the cost of a large amount of $(aura) - the more time skipped, the more will be consumed."
