Creating $(aura) using the $(item)Disentangler of Mortals$() is especially so: Killing any passive animal close to it will cause the animal's soul to be freed and spread into the environment in the form of a rather big amount of $(aura). For this, baby animals' souls are less fulfilled, causing less $(aura) to be dispersed."

To harvest souls at their most fulfilled, one should wait about $(thing)one and a half hours$() or so."
