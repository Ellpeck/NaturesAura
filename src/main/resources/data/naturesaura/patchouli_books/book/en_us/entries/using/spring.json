As for simple actions, the $(item)Everlasting Spring$() can fill $(item)cauldrons$() on top of it, $(item)sponges$() close to it and $(item)buckets$() used on it with water. It also irrigates $(thing)farmland$() in an area of five blocks around it."

Additionally, the spring is able to interact with $(item)lava$() in the following ways: If lava is placed one block away horizontally from it, a block of $(item)cobblestone$() will be generated. If the same is done, but vertically, $(item)stone$() is created instead. A block of lava directly next to the spring will turn into $(item)obsidian$().$(n)Of course, all of these actions require varying amounts of $(aura)."
